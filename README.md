# Multi-Party-TSS (ECDSA-DKLs23)

**Silent Shard** has been built using a cryptographic base of
**Multiparty computation (MPC).** MPC enables a set of parties that do
not trust each other to try to jointly compute a function (digital
signature generation in this case) over their inputs (key shards in
this case) while keeping those inputs privately stored with
them. Threshold signatures are a case enabled by multiparty
computation where a threshold number of parties, out of the previously
agreed group of approving (participating) nodes, can compute a
cryptographic digital signature. ECDSA is one type of such a signature
scheme based on elliptic curves.

Threshold Signatures (TSS) scheme protocols are multi-step and
interactive protocols built through cryptographic primitives and
zero-knowledge proofs to generate an indistinguishable signature as
generated by a wallet holding the private key in one place.

TSS consists of three stages:

- Distributed Key Generation (DKG),
- Distributed Signature Generation, and
- Proactive Security with Key rotation/refresh.

These functions involve cryptographic computing at the participating
nodes of the MPC quorum and exchanges of rounds of messages which
ultimately lead to the generation of a valid signature at the
requested node. These computing nodes can be any device with
sufficient computational and memory capability, including but not
limited to smartphones, server nodes, and edge devices. The basic
philosophy behind Silent Shard remains that no single device holding
the private key can be used to generate signatures and move digital
assets. The private key is shared among multiple computing nodes so
that no party has any information about the key. Then, in order to
generate a signature, the threshold number of devices run a secure
two-party computation protocol that generates the signature without
revealing anything about the parties' key shares to each other. These
devices may or may not be associated with the same person or
organization and can be any form factor. Thus, one could use this to
create a wallet, sharing the private key between one's mobile and
one's laptop, between one's mobile and a VM in the cloud, and so on.

# Protocol

Please note that the latest library of Silent Shard is based on DKLs23
TSS protocol.

# DKLs23

- Threshold ECDSA in Three Rounds: Now matches Schnorr.
- Enabled by well-chosen correlation + simple new consistency check.
- Blackbox use of UC 2-round 2P-MUL. It is to be noted that OT-based
  protocols satisfy UC, but AHE is more complicated.
- No (explicit) ZK proofs during signing or DKG; light protocol and
  straightforward UC analysis.
